# data2020Project3

In this project, our team is creating a dashboard page using D3.js to create a site with movie information. A query is conducted by the user using a search bar to find a particular movie. Once the movie is found a picture of the poster is shown, plus the title, the year it was released, the director, the genre(s) and a movie rating. This data will be provided with an API, and also a csv with relates the movies to streaming services that the movies appear on. Ideally, the user will be able to search for a movie using filters such as director, genre or streaming service.
