<h1>Data Visualization Project 3 </h1>

In this project, our team is creating a dashboard page using D3.js to create a site with movie information. A query is conducted by the user using a search bar to find a particular movie. Once the movie is found a picture of the poster is shown, plus the title, the year it was released, the director, the genre(s) and a movie rating. This data will be provided with an API, and also a CSV which relates the movies to streaming services that the movies appear on. Ideally, the user will be able to search for a movie using filters such as director, genre or streaming service. The user will also be able to search for two movies if desired and a comparison of the information provided by the data will be visualized.

3) Inspiring Visualization ideas:

We considered having a geographical interactive element showing locations of where movies are filmed.

The team really liked the look of this image visually. Although, it may be difficult to reproduce.

The dashboard idea really appealed to the team as we can share multiple types of data simultaneously.
